# Project Website

### Hello!

This is a website created by [Yun-Ting Yeh](https://ytyeh.github.io/foss-capstone/), following the weekly homework for **FOSS 2023 Capstone Project**. Currently, the website only contains contents related to my 2nd-year project (_in progress_). I plan to populate the website as my research progresses :smiley: :feet:.

### Short Bio

I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Arizona :cactus:. My research interests lie in the fields of **empirical industrial organization** and **environmental and energy economics**. I am currently working on a project that studies the relationship between water pollution and manufacturers' entry (2nd-year project) as well as a joint project that looks at smog inspection (preliminary).
