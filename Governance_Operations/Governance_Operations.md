## Governance and Operations Document
</br>
This document records project governance for my 2nd year project, "Cost of Pollution to Firms: Water Pollution and Beverage Manufacturers' Entry". This is a single-author project, so the following operations only apply to myself. This document will be updated to reflect changes as the project proceeds.

### Introduction
#### Project Overview
This project studies the relationship between water pollution and manufacturers' entry decisions. A draft of this project was presented at the 2nd-year conference at the Department of Economics. After receiving feedback at the conference, I plan to significantly revise the project, mostly on the choice of instrument. More information will be posted as soon as the major modification is completed.
